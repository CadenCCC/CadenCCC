# Caden

Hello, my name is Caden.
I am a developer that loves cybersecurity... and Minecraft.
I first started to love cybersecurity when trying to protect one of my projects.
If there was anything public/obfuscated, I tried to crack it, name it, and I've
probably tried cracking it.
I have been to school for cybersecurity, and like to think of myself as a
professional â€” whatever that means.

My alt account is [cryrobtrwew](https://github.com/cryrobtrwew).
I haven't done much there, but I like using multiple accounts to separate myself
from some communities.

More information like current projects will be filled out here as time goes on.

I love many languages, here are some of my favorites:
<pre>
- Java (I code this like 87% of the time)
- Python
- C++
- C#
