# Caden

Hello my name is Caden. I am a developer that loves cybersecurity... and Minecraft.
I first started to love cybersecurity when trying to protect one of my projects in the wayy past.
If there was anything public obfuscated I tried to crack it, like name it, and I've probably tried cracking it.
I have been to school for cybersecurity, and would like to think of myself as a "professional" whatever that means.

I have to separate accounts this one and https://github.com/cryrobtrwew, I just haven't done much there and I want to separate myself from some communities.

MORE information like current projects will be filled out here as time goes on.

There are multiple Languages I love writing in for example they are listed as:
<pre>
- Java (I code this like 87% of the time)
- Python
- C++
- C#
</pre>
