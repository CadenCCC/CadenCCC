# Hello!
I typically go around the internet as `CryroByte`, known to everyone in real life as Caden. I enjoy difficult projects a strive to make something as user friendly as I can, even if it makes the project a pain to make. I love to code in `Java` but I know multiple other languages, I just code in `Java` because it is just simple. I am involved in Cyber Security and it is my personal goal to do it for the rest of my life...

I have a previous account, [cryrobtrwew](https://github.com/cryrobtrwew)
